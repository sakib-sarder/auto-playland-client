                  What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work
                  and where should we store them on the client-side?

                <span className="block font-bold">Access Token:</span>
                An access token is a credential used to access protected
                resources or perform authorized actions. It is generated after
                successful authentication and contains user identification and
                permissions. When a client wants to access protected resources,
                it includes the access token in the request headers. The server
                validates the token, checks its validity and permissions, and
                grants or denies access accordingly. Access tokens have a
                limited lifespan and expire after a short period.
                <span className="block font-bold"> Refresh Token:</span>A
                refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new
                access token when the current one expires. It is issued during
                authentication and securely stored by the client application.
                When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh
                token to the token endpoint or authorization server. The server
                validates the refresh token and, if valid, issues a new access
                token. This process allows users to continue accessing resources
                without re-authenticating.{" "}
                <span className="block font-bold">Storage:</span> Tokens can be
                securely stored on the client-side using methods such as secure
                HTTP-only cookies, local storage, session storage, or token
                storage libraries. The choice of storage mechanism depends on
                the specific security requirements of the application. It is
                important to select a secure storage method to prevent
                unauthorized access to the tokens.

                    (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with SQL

                    capabilities are often simpler compared to SQL databases.

                Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application
                framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and
                utilities for building web applications and APIs. Express.js
                simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing,
                middleware management, and view rendering. It allows developers
                to quickly set up server-side applications and handle various
                aspects of web development.
                <span className="font-bold block py-1">Nest.js:</span>
                Nest.js is a progressive and opinionated framework for building
                efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications.
                It is built with TypeScript and heavily inspired by Angular,
                borrowing many of its concepts and architectural patterns.
                Nest.js focuses on modularity, dependency injection, and an
                organized folder structure to create robust and extensible
                applications.

                The aggregate function takes an array of stages as its

                be applied to the documents in the collection. The stages are
                executed sequentially, with the output of one stage serving as
                the input for the next stage.
